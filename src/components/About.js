				I'm a coder in one time zone, and a conductor in another.
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>I'm a maker, a solutions-strategist, and a champion for kindness.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>Code</h4>In my own projects, I'm particularly interested in the
				intersection of the arts and digital technology, and the possibilities
				for heightened creativity in real-world and networked spaces. I'm also
				passionate about smart digital solutions for a cleaner and fairer world.
				On contract, I especially love building code that inspires and enables
				creative work, and hope I can do work that brings society back towards
				seeing the arts as something to do rather than something to consume.
				Outside of that, I'll happily tackle anything interesting for good
				people, so send me your ideas!
				<br />
				<br />
				<h4>Conducting</h4>I am the Music Director for a cracking wee band in
				Kjipuktuk, Mi'kma'ki (Halifax, Nova Scotia - on the East Coast of
				Canada) called Symphony Nova Scotia. We work hard for many communities
				here, ranging from playing core classical and new works in the concert
				hall, to commissioning and presenting sell-out collaborations with Nova
				Scotian legends like Jah'mila, the Maritime Bhangra Group and
				"Mikmaltic" fiddler, Morgan Toney. We take large- and small-scale live
				art music to schools, museums, libraries and provincial halls, we
				livestream much of our work, and we make quirky little things with
				community partners, like rad videos for Art Gallery of Nova Scotia,
				pairing works in their exhibitions with pieces of music. Check out our{" "}
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SymphonyNovaScotia/featuredyoutube">
					YouTube channel
				</a>{" "}
				to see some of our work.
				<br />
				<br />
				I'm also co-chair of the Board of Directors for{" "}
				<a href="https://www.formidability.org">formidAbility</a>, and when time
				permits around being a mum, coding and renovating our 17th Century
				cottage in Scotland (true story), I take on a small number of guest
				conducting gigs. But these days, it has to be a pretty interesting
				project or spectacularly lovely people for me to prioritise it over
				other interests and commitments.
				<br />
				<br />
				My two worlds - conducting and code - have much in common: architectural
				overview, strategic thinking and mid-flow problem solving. Where
				conducting sets itself apart is the unique challenge it poses of the
				synchronous - and time-locked - synthesis of critical, analytical and
				expressive activity. Oh, all while controlling every muscle, joint and
				facal expression... The upside is it means the asynchronous nature of
				logic, syntax and design that I enjoy in code feel like flying for me. I
				can let my brain go deep into one sphere of activity at a time, have a
				cup of tea whenever I need to take a step back, and make my mistakes in
				private. Bliss.
